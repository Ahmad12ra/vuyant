TOPIC: PROGRESS BAR

When you get data from the DB that tells you your current XP and goal XP and then you get the % after dividing them don't multiply it by 100, instead multiply it by 86 this is because we want the maximum length of the cover is going to be (200px - (the circle width with the outline)).
Which if the width of the circle is 28px then if the element it's width is 100 so the full cover would be 72px and if the width 200 then 28 / 2 = 14 so 200 - 14 = 186 would be the full width of the cover,

When your level for example is 3 then the width of the lvl 2 element would be 100% so the looking doesn't get missed up.

When you are getting to write the code that automatically make the html for you, make the first part element to be in an if condition then what's after it to be in a loop and in an if condition starting from 3 and ending at 98 then after that loop you would print the element that contains 99 and 100.

What would the condition have?
The condition would check if the level that is in the DB is greater than the current number which would be 1,2,3,4....,99,100.
If it is greater then the current element it's cover would be 100%. And if the level that is in the DB isn't greater than the current number then it would see if the level that is in the DB is this one that is in the loop or not. If it is the number that is in the loop then it would check the 
(current XP / the goal XP) * 86, and the value that would come out would be placed in the element as style linear gradient.

TOPIC: PRIZES OVER PROGRESS BAR

The top part of the progress section in the vPass, it's width would be the width of the bottom part of the progress, you won't put the width straight away, insted it would be made like the bottom part, element by element and each element would be 200px width. The prize inside it's width would be 50-100 and you would put translateX(-14). 

Where did I get -14 from?                                    -14 would be the translateX only if the width of the down dot is 28 because 28/2 would be the center of the dot which would be 14.

The main element container it's width would be 200px and the prize in side it would be flexed to the end then you can either put padding right in the main element or translate the 
prize
